# Modified-Artificial-Potential-Field

1. APF_with_PGDA.m : Main code implementing the paper. (use k_lm = 0.2 (variable in change_field_2D.m))
2. APF_with_PGDA_Astar.m : Code for results to be compared with Astar (use k_lm = 0.1 (variable in change_field_2D.m))
3. car.m : Matlab function to add potential due to cars as obstacle.
4. change_field_2D.m : Matlab function to add potential at the local minimum.
